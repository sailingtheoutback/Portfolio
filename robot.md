# ü§ñ Robotics Challenge - Project Showcase

## üèÜ 2016 : Engineering Challenge

### üöÄ Overview
The Autonomous Robot was designed and developed to navigate an obstacle course autonomously. The robot features ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, motorized wheels for precise movement, and a Raspberry Pi for processing and control. This project was part of the National Robotics Competition, where the team secured 1st place! ü•á
