## üìÅ Completed Projects

### 1. **Constructed Home Lab**
   - **Overview:** 
     I designed and implemented a secure and efficient home network, integrating both wired and wireless components. The network is configured to optimize performance and security for various connected devices, including smart home IoT devices, a NAS for storage, and a Proxmox server for virtualization.
   
   - **Key Components:**
     - **Firewall:** PfSence installed on Protectli vault ‚Äì Acts as the main gateway and firewall for the network.
     - **Switch:** TP-Link TL-SG108E ‚Äì Provides wired connectivity for critical devices.
     - **Access Point:** Ubiquiti UAP-AC-LR ‚Äì Extends wireless coverage throughout the home.
     - **Proxmox Server:** Intel NUC ‚Äì Hosts multiple virtual machines for different network services.
   
   - **Security Features:**
     - Implemented **VLANs** to segregate network traffic between different device categories (e.g., IoT, NAS, workstations).
     - Enabled **WPA3 encryption** for wireless security.
     - Configured **port forwarding** for external access to the NAS, with **dynamic DNS** for seamless connectivity.

### 2. **Built Proxmox Server**
   - **Overview:**
     Set up a **Proxmox Virtual Environment** to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) for different purposes, such as security testing, hosting services, and learning about virtualization technologies. The Proxmox server allows efficient use of hardware resources while maintaining flexibility for future network expansion.
   
   - **Virtual Machines Hosted:**
     - **pfSense Firewall:** Provides routing and firewall services for the home network.
     - **Kali Linux:** Used for penetration testing and security research.
     - **Ubuntu Server:** Hosts internal websites and acts as a DNS resolver.
     - **Windows Server 2019:** Used for testing Windows environments and simulating a domain controller.
   
   - **Features:**
     - **Snapshots** for VMs to quickly restore environments.
     - Efficient resource management with **dynamic memory allocation**.
     - Centralized control and monitoring via the Proxmox web interface.
   
   - [View Detailed Project](./Proxmox.md)

### 3. **Installed and Configured pfSense Open Source Firewall**
   - **Overview:**
     Installed and configured a **pfSense firewall** to secure the home network and control traffic between different network segments. This open-source firewall provides a range of advanced security features, such as VPN access, intrusion detection, and traffic shaping.
   
   - **Key Features:**
     - **Firewall Rules:** Custom firewall rules were created to block unnecessary incoming traffic and allow safe internal communication.
     - **VPN Setup:** Configured **OpenVPN** to allow secure remote access to the home network.
     - **Traffic Shaping:** Optimized bandwidth allocation to prioritize high-demand applications like streaming and gaming.
     - **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Set up **Snort** for real-time traffic analysis and intrusion detection.
     - **Dynamic DNS:** Implemented **Dynamic DNS** to maintain consistent external access to services even with changing IP addresses.
   
   - **Security Measures:**
     - Blocked access to known malicious IP addresses.
     - Encrypted all DNS traffic using DNS over TLS.
     - Implemented **failover mechanisms** for dual-WAN connectivity to ensure uptime.
